remember to turn on your pre-commit hook:

	chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit


== Coding Style ==

Style is identical to that used in the Linux kernel, except with function names
on a newline, and a space between the function name and first parenthesis in a
function call, ie:

	indent -linux -pcs -psl

== Tests ==

We have two levels of tests: smoke and unit.

The smoke tests (run with 'make smoke-test') are very high level
check-for-segfaults kinds of tests. There is no validation of command output,
just the return code.

The unit tests (run with 'make check') Attempt to be true unit tests, not using
any external resources, and verifying the unit under test.

== Documentation ==

Run 'make doxygen' and then view doxygen/html/index.html.

== Enable Debug Logging ==

Set the "LOW_DEBUG" environment variable to 1. I.e.

    LOW_DEBUG=1 low info zsh
